<hr><div dir="ltr"><div>Ohayou,</div><div><br></div>My STOP TRIP button was accidentally pressed by my child while still on my way on the Cipularang toll road, even though my destination was Yogyakarta and there was no intention of stopping in Bandung. My question is whether my account will be charged a fine later or I can just continue my trip and press the START TRIP button on my Cantas menu without being charged a fine on my account?<br></div>
