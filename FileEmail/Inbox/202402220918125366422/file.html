<hr><div dir="ltr">Good afternoon.<br><br>I have bought an e-Ticket with the route Jakarta - Solo and have used the e-Ticket. But in the middle of the road I got out at the Kanci toll gate because I wanted to stay at my brother&#39;s house, the next day I continued my journey via the Pemalang toll gate. The question is that the previous e-Ticket can still be used or I have to buy again? and Will I be charged a fine on my Cantas application? or I can use the Cantas application and press Start Trip ???<br><br></div>
