<hr><p>Dear Ms Marisya Kusuma,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Cantas is a mobile phone app for implementing cashless toll payment transaction which done in normal speed with touchless/MLFF technology. Cantas stands for &ldquo;Cepat Tanpa Stop.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Cantas, we have several different levels of fine, determined by the time after a violation:</p>

<p>Level 1 Fine: This is issued immediately after a violation occurs.</p>

<p>Level 2 Fine: Issued after the fine is not paid within 2 to 10 days after the violation.</p>

<p>Level 3: 1.5 toll rates for a duration of more than 10x24 hours until an indefinite time. At this level, toll gates will not open and STNK renewal will be blocked.</p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding a fine you received, please provide us with additional details.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are some differences on between apps :</p>

<p>1. you dont need to order Sticker, with CANTAS app you just need register your Vehicle from Apps</p>

<p>2. you can track your travel history in detail from the Cantas app</p>

<p>3. In the future, the Cantas application can top up using several different E-wallets.</p>

<p>in summary, all registrations and top-ups are done through the CANTAS app.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can check or accept &quot;<strong>Share Vehicle</strong>&quot; invitation from other users with these steps:</p>

<p>1. From main menu, select &quot;<strong>Invitation</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>2. Select &quot;<strong>Check vehicle invitations</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>or you can use these steps instead:</p>

<p>2. Select &quot;<strong>Vehicles sharing invitations</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
