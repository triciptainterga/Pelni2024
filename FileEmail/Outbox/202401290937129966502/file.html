<hr><p>Dear Mr. Fahmi,&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well Mr.Fahmi, we can inform you that Cantas is a smart application designed with (MLFF) or Multi Lane Free Flow system that utilize &nbsp;(GNSS) or Global Navigation Satellite System technology &nbsp;which allows vehicle users to make payments just by using their device without having to stop.<br />
<br />
as for&nbsp;the difference between the old toll system and MLFF are:<br />
1. With the old system you need to stop at the toll gate to pay, with MLFF or Cantas app, you no longer need to stop to pay the toll.<br />
2. The old toll system creates queue at the toll gates, with MLFF or Cantas app, there will be no more queueing at the toll gate.&nbsp;<br />
3. By no longer having queues, there will be no more traffic jams near toll gates which will ultimately reduce fuel waste and air pollution.<br />
4. Compared to the old toll system, you can now track your travel history in detail from the Cantas app&quot;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at xxxx.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation</p>
