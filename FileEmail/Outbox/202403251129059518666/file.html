<hr><p>Dear Mr. Cesar,</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Regarding the question that Mr. Cesar raised. We can inform you that&nbsp;<br />
If you receive a notification of payment of the fine but you forget or do not pay it, then you will be charged a fine, which is divided into several levels as follows:<br />
- level 1 : 1.5 toll rate in duration more than 2 hours up to 2x24 hours<br />
- level 2 : 1.5 toll tariff in duration more than 2x24 hours up to 10x24 hours. At this level the toll gate will not open.<br />
- Level 3: 1.5 toll tariffs in a duration of more than 10x24 hours to infinity. At this level the toll gate will not open and the STNK extension will be blocked.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the information we can convey and we recommend that you immediately pay the fine so that it does not become an obstacle later when you want to enter the toll gate.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
