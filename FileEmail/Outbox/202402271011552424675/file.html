<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

- Not sharing the vehicle with relatives or family<br />
- Your car has been registered by relatives or family&nbsp;</p>

<p>If these conditions have been confirmed and you do not feel that you have done this, we suggest you to check the &quot;Fine History&quot; menu and later you will be able to see the details of what violations have been made previously.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
