<hr><p>Dear Mr. Muhammad Alvin Juliardy Santofia,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We apologize for any inconvenience. We understand your question regarding the fine scheme and also the problems you are experiencing regarding getting a fine notification when exiting the toll road. The fine scheme that applies to the Cantas application is as follows:</p>

<p>Level 1 Fine: This is issued immediately after a violation occurs.</p>

<p>Level 2 Fine: Issued after the fine is not paid within 2 to 10 days after the violation.</p>

<p>Level 3: 1.5 toll rates for a duration of more than 10x24 hours until an indefinite time. At this level, toll gates will not open and STNK renewal will be blocked.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the next time, please make sure to have a stable internet connection while on the toll road because our system will detect your vehicle when passing through the Gantry and also please make sure to have enough balance when using Cantas while traveling.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In accordance with the fine scheme that we have stated earlier, please pay the fines obtained a maximum of 2 days after you receive the notification so that you can still use your vehicle when traveling on toll roads using the Cantas application service.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
