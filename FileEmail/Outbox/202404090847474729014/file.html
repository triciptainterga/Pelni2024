<hr><p>Dear Mr Cesar,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Regarding your email about the meaning of cantas, we can inform you that for now the system you are referring to is the MLFF (Multi Lane Free Flow) system, which is a toll payment system without having to stop the vehicle. MLFF technology is present in Indonesia and is the first technology to implement a contactless cashless toll payment system or pay tolls without stopping based on an application called the CANTAS application for all classes of vehicle types. The MLFF system uses Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) digital technology that allows toll road users&#39; trips to be known through GPS on smart phones.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
