<hr><p>Dear Ms Setiawati Jayanti,</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>In connection with question Ms Setiawati, we can inform you that the use of Cantas on ambulance cars is currently the same as other users by registering personal data and vehicle data in the Cantas application then pressing the &quot;Star Trip&quot; button when you want to enter the toll gate. Then we can inform you that Cantas users on ambulance cars will not be charged toll rates because these ambulance cars include cars that are prioritized.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
