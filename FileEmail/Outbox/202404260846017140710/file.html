<hr><p>Dear Mr Ramadhanivino2,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Well, we can inform you regarding the question that you can use your new vehicle by using the Cantas application, but it is certain that the vehicle has been registered in the Cantas application, if the vehicle has not been registered, you can register it first by adding a vehicle in the Cantas application, the following steps need to be taken:<br />
1. Select the &ldquo;Account&rdquo; menu<br />
2. Select the &ldquo;Vehicle&rdquo; menu<br />
3. Click the &ldquo;Add Vehicle&rdquo; button or Plus Sign<br />
4. Select the Toll category that matches your vehicle<br />
5. Enter your vehicle information, then click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;<br />
6. Upload front and back photos of your vehicle. then click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;<br />
7. Upload a photo of the front and back of your vehicle registration.<br />
8. Click &ldquo;Finish&rdquo;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
