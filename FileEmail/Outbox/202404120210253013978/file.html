<hr><p>Dear Mr Cesar Yasin,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>The weaknesses of MLFF are as follows:</p>

<p>1. GNSS-based MLFF is highly dependent on the GSM cellular network (3G/4G/5G) along the toll road.</p>

<p>2. There must be an additional OBU in the vehicle or e-OBU in the smartphone.</p>

<p>3. Not all toll road users have mastered IT technology on GNSS-based smartphones.</p>

<p>4. There is always a balance in the e-wallet.</p>

<p>5. There is always internet data on smart devices when on the toll road.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, along with the development of time and technology, some of these weaknesses will be resolved with further socialization so that other people can easily use the MLFF system</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
