<hr><p>Dear Mr Muhammad Alvin Juliardy Santofia,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

3. Select &quot;&quot;Delete my account&quot;&quot;<br />
4. Enter the OTP code sent to your Whatsapp</p>

<p>Please note that the process of deleting account will take 15 days. You can cancel this process anytime within those 15 days by logging in again. After deleting the account, information related to travel history, fine history, and other information previously recorded in your account will also be deleted.</p>

<p>We may inform you that for now the remaining balance cannot be cashed out and transferred to another E-Wallet. In addition, due to the current condition of system optimization, There will be future plans so that users can withdraw their money. However, this is currently still under internal discussion with BJB Bank (To be advised).</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
