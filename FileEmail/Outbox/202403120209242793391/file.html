<hr><p>Dear Mr Malikiyaumiddin,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Regarding your question, we can inform you that currently, motorcycles or two wheels vehicles are not listed in Cantas app. This means that you cannot register such vehicles in Cantas app or use the vehicles in the toll road with Cantas as the payment system. You can however, use a different payment system such as e-toll card while using a motorcycle in Bali.</p>

<p>We hope this information can help you.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
