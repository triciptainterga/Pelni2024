<hr><p>Dear Ms Ryanti,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Very well, Ms Ryanti. We can inform you that at this time the system you are referring to is the MLFF (Multi Lane Free Flow) system, namely a toll payment system without having to stop the vehicle. MLFF technology is present in Indonesia and is the first technology to implement an application-based contactless cashless or non-stop toll payment system called the CANTAS application for all vehicle types. The MLFF system uses digital Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology which allows toll road users&#39; journeys to be known via GPS on smartphones.</p>

<p>One of the requirements for using the Cantas application is that the device specifications required for your smartphone must have at least the Android 10 operating system if you are an Android user and iOS 13 if you are an iPhone user.</p>

<p>Regarding when the CANTAS application can be used, it will be announced through the official media of PT. Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) and official PUPR media. Please wait for the latest information from us.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
