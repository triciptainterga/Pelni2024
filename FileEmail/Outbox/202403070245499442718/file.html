<hr><p>Dear Mrs Lika Travelio,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Regarding Mrs Likat Travelia question here are the differences between Cantas and OBU:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;1. For OBU (On Board Unit) is a device while Cantas is an application that can be downloaded via smartphone.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;2. In its work system, OBU still uses device or in the form of a sticker while Cantas does not require a device and is only based on a GPS system that detects toll road user trips.<br />
&nbsp;3. To use OBU, users must make a purchase first.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Cantas is a mobile application to implement a cashless toll payment transaction system carried out at normal speed using contactless technology or known as Multi Lane Free Flow (MLFF). &nbsp;Cantas means &quot;fast without stopping&quot;. In the Big Indonesian Dictionary, Cantas means gallant, handsome, brave, firm, skillful.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
