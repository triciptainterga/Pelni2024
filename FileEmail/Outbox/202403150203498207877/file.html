<hr><p>Dear Mr. Cesar Yasin,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regarding your question about how to delete other vehicles, we can tell you that shareing vehicles can be deleted through the first account that shared the vehicle with other users.</p>

<p>The way to delete a vehicle is as follows:<br />
1. Enter the &quot;Account&quot; menu<br />
2. Then the &quot;Vehicle&quot; menu<br />
3. Select the license plate of the vehicle you want to delete<br />
4. Select &quot;Delete vehicle&quot;<br />
5. Done</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
