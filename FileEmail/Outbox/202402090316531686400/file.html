<hr><p>Dear Mr Pandu Cahyo Utomo,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Good afternoon Mr Pandu Cahyo Utomo, for now you can make payments other than using DigiRoad, you can use QRis which can make payments through the available E Wallet. To be able to directly connect to payments via Gopay or OVO in the future we will provide, please always wait for our latest updates through our official platform.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at xxxx.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
