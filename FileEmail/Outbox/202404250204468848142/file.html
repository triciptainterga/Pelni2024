<hr><p>Dear Ms Marisya Kusuma,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Regarding Ms&nbsp;Marisya Kusuma question we would like to inform you here are benefit using Cantas application:<br />
1. Toll road users do not stop in payment, without lowering the speed of the vehicle in tolling<br />
2. Prevents congestion in payment at the toll booth<br />
3. Can be downloaded on smart devices as an Electronic On Board Unit or e-OBU<br />
4. Can be used in real time regardless of time and weather.<br />
5. The use of GNSS in relative positioning is not affected by the topographical conditions of the region.<br />
7. The position determined refers to global time which is relatively precise and easy to realize.<br />
8. Provides positioning accuracy with a wide enough spectrum.<br />
9. Free of charge.<br />
10. Efficient in time, operational costs and manpower.<br />
11. Data manipulation on GNSS is more difficult to do</p>
