<hr><p>Dear Ms. Dhea Kurniawati,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We can inform you that&nbsp;The MLFF System operates by detecting either the E-OBU device or the CANTAS app installed on the customer&#39;s smartphone. It uses GNSS to pinpoint the vehicle&#39;s location and cameras on the Gantry to read the license plate and vehicle type, ensuring it matches the customer&#39;s registered information. Using the MLFF system simplifies payment processing and reduces congestion at Toll gates, eliminating the need for electronic card tapping previously required.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
