<hr><p>Dear Head Office Bdg,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We may informed that once you have purchased an e-ticket, you cannot change your destination trip.<br />
The route determined at the time of planning must be used. If a vehicle uses the toll road on a different section, it is considered an unauthorized use of the toll road.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
