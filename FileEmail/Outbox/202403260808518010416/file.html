<hr><p>Dear Mr Antony.tmb,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Good regarding your question above regarding payment via &quot;OVO&quot; in the Cantas application, we inform you that the payment method via &quot;OVO&quot; is currently not available in the CANTAS application but it does not rule out the possibility that in the future the payment method with &quot;OVO&quot; will be available in the Cantas application.</p>

<p>however, you can use the Qris feature on the &quot;OVO&quot; service available on your OVO application by .</p>

<p>You can top up your balance via Digiroad by using QRIS for bank account owners.</p>

<p>1. Select <strong>TOPUP BALANCE</strong></p>

<p>2. Enter the Phone Number registered in digiRoad (example: 628123456xxxxxxx)</p>

<p>3. Input the top-up amount</p>

<p>4. Scan QRIS through the application you choose then complete the payment.</p>

<p>5. Click &quot;<strong>PAID</strong>&quot; button</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
