<hr><p>Dear Ms Sekar,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>we may informed that&nbsp;Regarding the fine you&#39;ve received, we would like to provide clarification on our system.</p>

<p>At Cantas, we have several different levels of fine, determined by the time after a violation:</p>

<p>Level 1 Fine: This is issued immediately after a violation occurs.<br />
Level 2 Fine: Issued after the fine is not paid within 2 to 10 days after the violation.<br />
Level 3 Fine: Issued after the fine remains unpaid beyond 10 days.</p>

<p>We can suggest that you pay it as soon as you receive the fine information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at xxxx.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
