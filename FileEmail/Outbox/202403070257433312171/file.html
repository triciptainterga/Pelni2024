<hr><p>Dear Mr. Cesar Yasin,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>For the inauguration of the Cantas application, it will be announced through the official media of PT Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) and the official PUPR media. Please wait for the latest info from us.</p>

<p>To use the Cantas application, things that need to be considered:<br />
&nbsp;1. Make sure you have added your vehicle data on the &quot;Vehicle&quot; menu&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;2. Make sure you have activated one of the payment methods available in the Cantas application<br />
&nbsp;3. On the home page of the application select the &quot;Trip&quot; menu<br />
&nbsp;4. Select the vehicle to be used. Make sure the vehicle to be used is the same as the one selected in the application<br />
&nbsp;5. Press the &quot;Start Trip&quot; button to start the trip with the Cantas application<br />
&nbsp;6. Make sure the &quot;Start Trip&quot; button has been clicked before entering the toll gate so as not to be subject to fines<br />
&nbsp;7. Press the &quot;Stop Trip&quot; button when you exit the toll gate. If you forget to click the &quot;Stop Trip&quot; button, the system will stop the trip automatically after 2 hours out of the toll road.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
