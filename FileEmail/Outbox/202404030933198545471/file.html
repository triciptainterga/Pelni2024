1. Make sure you have added your vehicle data to your &quot;Vehicle&quot; menu<br />
2. Make sure you have activated one of the payment methods available on the Cantas application<br />
3. On the home page of the application select the &quot;Trip&quot; menu<br />
4. Select the vehicle you will use. Make sure the vehicle you will use is the same as the one you selected in the application<br />
