<hr><p>Dear Mr Pandu,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We may informed you that you also have to upload a photo of your vehicle registration and a photo of your vehicle, because the system at the toll road will detect passing cars. so if you upload a photo of your vehicle registration and a photo of your vehicle, it will be detected in the system.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at xxxx.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
