<hr><p>Dear Mr/Ms,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.<br />
<br />
Alright Mr. Reinhard , according your question about new payment method we could inform you that right now there is new payment method for toll road, it is CANTAS. CANTAS itself using MLFF system, MLFF stands for &quot;Multi Lane Free Flow&quot; which is a contactless toll payment system that can be done without having to stop at the toll gate. This system is implemented in Indonesia through the CANTAS app with GNSS technology which uses GPS on smartphones to track the journey of toll road users. Currently, the CANTAS application is still in the trial phase on the Bali toll road, and in the future it will gradually be implemented on all toll roads in Indonesia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For using Cantas application, kindly Mr. Reinhard follow theses steps below:<br />
1. Make sure you have added your vehicle data to your &quot;Vehicle&quot; menu&nbsp;<br />
2. Make sure you have activated one of the payment methods available on the Cantas application&nbsp;<br />
3. On the home page of the application select the &quot;Trip&quot; menu&nbsp;<br />
4. Select the vehicle you will use. Make sure the vehicle you will use is the same as the one you selected in the application&nbsp;<br />
5. Click &quot;Start Trip&quot; button to start your trip with the Cantas application<br />
6. Make sure you have clicked the &quot;Start Trip&quot; before entering the toll gate<br />
7. Click &quot;Stop Trip&quot; button after you exit the toll gate. If you forget to click the &quot;Stop Trip&quot; , the system will automatically end the trip after 30 minutes while you&#39;re outside of the toll road</p>

<p>Later, if Mr. Reinhard as an expatriate in Bali, we can inform if you rent a vehicle, you can coordinate with the vehicle owner or rental so that it can be ensured that the vehicle you rent is shared by the rental vehicle owner and you are not required to register the vehicle yourself to avoid violations or fines caused by the negligence of other drivers using the same vehicle. For now, CANTAS is still awaiting confirmation from related parties which will be announced through the official media of PT Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) and the official Ministry of Public Works and Housing (PUPR) media. Kindly check it periodically in https://pu.go.id/ or @kemenpupr. Temporarily during the transition period,&nbsp;you can use E-Money as an optional payment method. But, after the transition era has close, so you cannot use E-Money as a payment method anymore.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2x24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.<br />
<br />
