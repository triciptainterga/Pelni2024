<hr><p>Dear Mr. Ramavino,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.<br />
<br />
Very well, Mr. Ramavino. There is an application which as new payment method to enter the toll road, the name is Cantas. Unfortunatelly, for now&nbsp;not currently available to access for public. Once it is ready, it will be announced through the official channels of PT. Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) and the official channels of the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR). We appreciate your patience for the latest updates from us, Mr. Ramavino. For additional information, internal trial of the MLFF system has been tested in Bali at the Ngurah Rai Toll Gate (GT), Bali Mandara Toll Road on December 15 2023, and in the future it will gradually be implemented on all toll roads in Indonesia.<br />
<br />
Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from Mr. Ramavino within 2x24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
If Mr. Ramavino still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.<br />
This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
