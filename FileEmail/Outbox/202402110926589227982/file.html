<hr><p>Dear Ms. Lika,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>During the transition period, the fine will not increase but the barrier at the toll booth will not open. In the future, users will be fined under the following conditions:</p>

<p>Level 1: 3x the toll rate if paying within a duration of more than 2 hours to 2x24 hours;&nbsp;<br />
Level 2: 5x the toll rate if paying within a duration of more than 2x24 hours to 10x24 hours;&nbsp;<br />
Level 3: 10x the toll rate if paying within a duration of more than 10x24 hours until it leads to blocking the vehicle registration if not paid within the specified time limit.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at xxxx.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
