<hr><p>Dear Mr Mamo Tampan,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We can inform you that there are 5 groups of vehicle you can register in your Cantas account. For vehicles like trucks, you can choose between these groups:</p>

<p>1. Group 2 (trucks with 2 axles)<br />
2. Group 3 (trucks with 3 axles, including trailer cars)<br />
3. Group 4 (trucks with 4 axles)<br />
4. Group 5 (trucks with 5 axles or more)</p>

<p>As some vehicles may have been modified, we can only suggest you to choose between these groups according to the amount of axles on your vehicle instead of your vehicle&#39;s brand.</p>

<p>We hope this information can help you.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
