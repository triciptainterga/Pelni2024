<hr><p>Dear Mr Mamonyantai27,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>The way the MLFF system works is by detecting the E-OBU or your mobile phone that has the CANTAS application installed, based on GNSS to see the location of your vehicle, and is also supported by the detection camera located on the Gantry which will detect the vehicle number plate and also the vehicle group, whether it matches the one registered by the customer. With the use of the MLFF system, it will facilitate the payment process and will reduce congestion at the entrance and exit of the Toll which was previously required to tap the electronic money card.</p>

<p>And we inform you about vehicle rental or borrowing, you need to make sure the vehicle you rent has been shared by the vehicle owner or rental party (share vehicle) before you use the vehicle. We recommend that you do not register the vehicle you borrow or rent yourself in your Cantas account to avoid collecting fines caused by other users in the future.</p>

<p>And to get more information, you can email us at care@cantas.id or whatsapp number at 081286305888</p>

<p>for previous payment methods using cards (e-money, flazz, brizzy, etc.) until now can still be used.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
