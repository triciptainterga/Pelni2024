<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We understand your questions about how to change username and add DigiRoad balance using Bank BJB Mobile Banking. We are sorry to inform you that changing the username in the Cantas application is currently not possible. You can create a new Cantas account with another username that you want with another phone number that is connected to Whatsapp.</p>

<p>If you want to create an account with a new username but still use the previous phone number, you can delete the account with a processing time of 15 days for permanent deletion. After deleting the account, information related to travel history, fine history, and other information previously recorded in your account will also be deleted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can top up your balance via Digiroad by using Bank BJB Mobile Banking here are the steps.</p>

<p>1. Login to DIGI MOBILE application</p>

<p>2. Select Top-Up e-Wallet Menu</p>

<p>4. Input the Phone Number registered on digiRoad (example: 628123456xxxxxxx)</p>

<p>5. Input the Top Up Amount</p>

<p>6. Input Digi Mobile M-PIN</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
