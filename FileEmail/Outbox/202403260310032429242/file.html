<hr><p>Dear Mr. Dody,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Okay Mr. Dody, We may inform you that for now the remaining balance cannot be cashed out and transferred to another E-Wallet. In addition, due to the current condition of system optimization, There will be future plans so that users can withdraw their money. However, this is currently still under internal discussion with BJB Bank</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Will it be lost/forfeited? Can it be transferred to another account? Can it be refunded to bank account? <br></div><div><br></div><div>Many thanks</div><div>Dody Setiawan<br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
