<hr><p>Dear Mr. Ilham Ramadhan,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We inform you that if you will pass through the open toll road and exit at the closed toll road, you don&#39;t need to start the trip twice. You only need to press the start trip button when you are enter the toll road.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
