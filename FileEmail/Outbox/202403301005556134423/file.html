<hr><p>Dear Mr Mamotampan,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Very well, Mr Mamotampan for the launched of the Cantas application will be announced through the official media of PT Roatex Indonesia Toll Sistem (RITS) and the official Ministry of Public Works and Housing (PUPR) media. Please take the time to wait for the latest info from us.</p>

<p>Okay, Mr. Mamotampan, the device specifications required to use the Cantas application are smartphones running the Android operating system (Android 10 or higher) or iOS (iOS 13 or higher).</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
