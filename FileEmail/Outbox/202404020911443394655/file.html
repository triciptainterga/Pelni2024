<hr><p>Dear Mr Yoga,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Very well, Mr Yoga, For the official Cantas website at this time we cannot inform you, if it is available it will be announced through the official media of PT. Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) and currently the Roatex website has not been released, or it can also be through the official (Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing) PUPR media. Please wait for the latest info from us.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
