<hr><p>Dear Ms Ryantirhy,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We may informed that&nbsp;some of the advantages of GNSS-based MLFF system, among others:</p>

<p>1. Toll road users do not stop in payment, without lowering the speed of the vehicle in tolling</p>

<p>2. Prevents congestion in payment at the toll booth</p>

<p>3. Can be downloaded on smart devices as an Electronic On Board Unit or e-OBU</p>

<p>4. Can be used in real time regardless of time and weather.</p>

<p>5. The use of GNSS in relative positioning is not affected by the topographical conditions of the region.</p>

<p>7. The position determined refers to global time which is relatively precise and easy to realize.</p>

<p>8. Provides positioning accuracy with a wide enough spectrum.</p>

<p>9. Free of charge.</p>

<p>10. Efficient in time, operational costs and manpower.</p>

<p>11. Data manipulation on GNSS is more difficult to do</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The weaknesses of MLFF are as follows:</p>

<p>1. GNSS-based MLFF is highly dependent on the GSM cellular network (3G/4G/5G) along the toll road.</p>

<p>2. There must be an additional OBU in the vehicle or e-OBU in the smartphone.</p>

<p>3. Not all toll road users have mastered IT technology on GNSS-based smartphones.</p>

<p>4. There is always a balance in the e-wallet.</p>

<p>5. There is always internet data on smart devices when on the toll road.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, along with the development of time and technology, some of these weaknesses will be resolved with further socialization so that other people can easily use the MLFF system.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
