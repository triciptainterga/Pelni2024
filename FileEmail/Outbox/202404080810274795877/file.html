<hr><p>Dear Mr.Fahmi,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We are sorry for the inconvinience, but to fully enjoy the Cantas application, we kindly recommend using smartphones that operate on the Android operating system (version 10 or higher) or iOS (version 13 or higher). In the event that you encounter compatibility issues, we may suggest alternative devices or encourage you to register on the Cantas website once it becomes operational. However, please note that to initiate a trip, it is essential to utilize the Cantas app on your mobile device</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
