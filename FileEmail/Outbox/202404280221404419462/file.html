<hr><p>Dear Mr/Ms Mamo Tampan,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Answering the questions from your email, the new method to be used for toll road payment that will be implemented on Bali&#39;s toll roads is MLFF. MLFF is &quot;Multi Lane Free Flow&quot; which is a contactless toll payment system that can be done without having to stop at the toll gate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More information will be conveyed through announcements from the official website of the Ministry of Public Works and Housing and RITS (Roatex Indonesian Toll System) through web portals and social media.</p>

<p>Please stay tuned for further developments and the MLFF system is not available for use at this time. But you don&#39;t need to worry because the use of old systems such as other electronic card payments is still available.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
