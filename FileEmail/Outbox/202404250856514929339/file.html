<hr><p>Dear Mr Mamo,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We inform you that vehicle information that has been registered cannot be changed, we recommend deleting the vehicle first and registering it again. To delete a vehicle in Cantas by following these steps:<br />
&nbsp; 1. Go to the &quot;Account&quot; menu<br />
&nbsp; 2. Select &quot;Vehicle&quot;<br />
&nbsp; 3. Select the vehicle you want to delete<br />
&nbsp; 4. Select &quot;Delete Vehicle&quot; at the bottom<br />
&nbsp; 5. Select &quot;Yes, Delete&quot;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>
