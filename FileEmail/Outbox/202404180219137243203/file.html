<hr><p>Dear Mr Cesar,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Very well Mr Cesar, these are some differences on between apps and other:</p>

<p>1. You do not need to order Sticker, with CANTAS app you just need register your Vehicle from Apps</p>

<p>2. You can track your travel history in detail from the Cantas app</p>

<p>3. In the future, the Cantas application can top up using several different E-wallets.</p>

<p>in summary, all registrations and top-ups are done through the CANTAS app.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
