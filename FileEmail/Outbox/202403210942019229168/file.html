<hr><p>Dear Mr Wahyudin Subakti,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Regarding your questions, we can inform you that Cantas app is exclusively available in Indonesia and cannot be used outside Indonesia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also can inform you that if you rent a vehicle, you can coordinate with the vehicle owner or rental so that it can be ensured that the vehicle you rent is shared by the rental vehicle owner and you are not required to register the vehicle yourself to avoid violations or fines caused by the negligence of other drivers using the same vehicle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We hope this information can help you.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
