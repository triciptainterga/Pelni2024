<hr><p>Dear Mr Dody Setiawan,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Answering Mr. Dody&#39;s Email, regarding adjustments to the toll road during traffic jams by traffic control officers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there is an adjustment to the toll lane used and the type of toll road is OPEN, the payment will be charged according to the nominal when entering the toll road used.</p>

<p>You do not need to worry because you will not be charged anything and can exit the toll road from the officer&#39;s direction to adjust the traffic jam on the toll road.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

The question is how many times will I be charged for this case?  <br clear="all"><div><div dir="ltr" class="gmail_signature" data-smartmail="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><br><div>Many thanks</div><div>Dody Setiawan<br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
