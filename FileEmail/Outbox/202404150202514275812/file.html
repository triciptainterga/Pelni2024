<hr><p>Dear Mrs Setiawati Jayanti,</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>In connection with your e-mail for now the Cantas application cannot be accessed if there is no internet. If you have finished the toll road trip, it doesn&#39;t matter if your cellphone is off / off or loses the internet network, but if you plan to continue traveling on other toll roads, we recommend that you immediately turn on the cellphone that is connected to the internet network.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
