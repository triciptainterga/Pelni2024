<hr><p>Dear Mr Dody Setiawan,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Answering Mr. Dody&#39;s Email, in that situation where you have paid the Toll Trip (OPEN) but you exit the toll road due to the direction of the traffic officer.</p>

<p>Because you have paid the Toll Trip (OPEN) where the payment is the initial trip amount from the toll gate to the next toll gate so you will not get additional fees when exiting.</p>

<p>If you enter a new section of the toll road (Closed), the new calculation will increase according to the distance of the section that has been passed until the exit of the toll gate.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
