<hr><p>Dear Mr. Antony,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We wanted to alert you to potential fraudulent emails falsely representing Cantas. Your security is our priority, so please take note of the following: Official Cantas Email: Our official email address for all communications is care@cantas.id. Be cautious of emails claiming to be from Cantas but originating from different addresses. Passwords and OTPs: Never share your passwords or One-Time Passwords (OTPs) with anyone, including Cantas representatives. We will never ask for such sensitive information via email or any other means.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
