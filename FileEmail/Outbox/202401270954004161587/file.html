<hr><p>Dear Ms. Sekar Syafira,&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alright Ms. Sekar, according to your issue about do not receive an OTP code during the registration process, please note the following:&nbsp;<br />
1. The phone number entered is correct and appropriate and registered with the WhatsApp Application&nbsp;<br />
2. The phone number that you registered (which is registered with the Whatsapp application) belongs to you, not someone else<br />
3. Press the &quot;send me a new code&quot; button on the application to send the OTP code again if the OTP code is not received within 10 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, Ms. Sekar can contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 9238 0699.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
