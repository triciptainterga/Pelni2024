<hr><p>Dear Ms. Ryanti Rahmawati,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regarding your question about how to change your username and password, we can tell you that&nbsp;changing the username in the Cantas application is currently not possible. You can create a new Cantas account with another username that you want with another phone number that is connected to Whatsapp.</p>

<p>If you want to create an account with a new username but still use the previous phone number, you can delete the account with a processing time of 15 days for permanent deletion. After deleting the account, information related to travel history, fine history, and other information previously recorded in your account will also be deleted.</p>

<p>Related to how to change password, here are the steps:</p>

<p>1. Select forgot password on the application home screen<br />
2. Select and enter the mobile number or email registered in the Cantas application, then create a new password<br />
4. Then you will receive a link to change your password sent to WhatsApp or email<br />
5. Open the link which will automatically enter the Web view to create a new password<br />
6. You will be asked to create a new password and confirm the new password. After that select create a new password</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
