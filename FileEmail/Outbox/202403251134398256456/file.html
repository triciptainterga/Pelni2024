<hr><p>Dear Mr. Muhammad Alvin Juliardy</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Regarding the question that Mr. Alvin raised. We can inform you we can inform you that the &#39;VDU number is invalid&#39; on the vehicle you selected in the &quot;share vehicle&quot; menu is information that the vehicle has been deleted by the user who owns the vehicle, so it cannot be used at this time. We suggest that you contact the owner of the vehicle that invited you previously and ask for your account to be invited back so that you can use the vehicle.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
