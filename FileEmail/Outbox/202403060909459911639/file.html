<hr><p>Dear Mrs Lika.travelio.</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>OK, Mrs. Lika.travelio, here is an explanation of the differences between Cantas and OBU:</p>

<p>1. OBU (On Board Unit) is a physical device, while Cantas is an application that can be downloaded via cellphone.<br />
2. In its working system, OBU still uses physical equipment or in the form of stickers, while Cantas does not require physical equipment and is only based on a GPS system that detects toll road users&#39; journeys.<br />
3. To use OBU, users must make a purchase first.<br />
Meanwhile, Cantas is a mobile application for implementing a non-cash toll payment transaction system which is carried out at normal speed using contactless technology or known as Multi Lane Free Flow (MLFF).<br />
Cantas means &quot;fast without stopping&quot;. In the Big Indonesian Dictionary, Cantas means dashing, handsome, brave, firm, skilled.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
