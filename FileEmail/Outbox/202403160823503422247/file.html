<hr><p>Dear Ms.Lika ,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Here are the differences between the MLFF and SLFF systems as reported on the official website of the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing:</p>

<p>MLFF System<br />
MLFF is an application-based system utilizing global navigation satellite system (GNSS) technology, which is set to replace the existing card-based non-cash payment method. In this system, transactions in MLFF without physical contact utilize the Electronic On-Board Unit (E-OBU). Through this system, road users are expected to achieve cost efficiency in operations and reduce fuel consumption. According to data from the Toll Road Regulatory Agency (BPJT) official website, the World Bank data for 2019 indicates that Indonesia suffered a loss of US$4 billion or approximately Rp56 trillion due to traffic congestion. Based on the Roatex MLFF Feasibility Study data for 2020, losses due to queues at toll gates are estimated to reach US$300 million or approximately Rp4.4 trillion per year. Currently, GNSS-based MLFF technology has been implemented in several countries such as Germany, Hungary, Belgium, Russia, and the Czech Republic. However, its application in these countries is limited to heavy vehicles and logistics. Meanwhile, this method has also been implemented in Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, the United States, and others, albeit with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. This technology reads devices attached to vehicles.</p>

<p>SLFF System<br />
In Indonesia, a similar payment method is better known as Single Lane Free Flow (SLFF). However, it employs RFID and Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) technologies to store vehicle identity data through devices attached within the vehicles. SLFF has been implemented by PT Jasa Marga Tbk. (JSMR) subsidiary, PT Jasamarga Tollroad Operator (JMTO), since 2020, albeit limited to certain toll gates. This technology is implemented using RFID stickers integrated with the &#39;Let It Flo&#39; application. The DSRC system operates by exchanging information between the device and the reader using 5.8 GHz waves at close range and low energy emissions. The reader, positioned above the road at toll gates or gantries, effectively detects and categorizes passing vehicles, enabling more accurate tariff determination based on vehicle type and distance traveled.</p>
