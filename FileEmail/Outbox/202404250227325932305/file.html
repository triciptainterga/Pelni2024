<hr><p>Dear Mr Amin,</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Very Well Mr.Amin. We can inform you that maybe what Mr. Amin is referring to is Cantas, where Cantas is an application designed with (MLFF) or Multi Lane Free Flow system that utilize &nbsp;(GNSS) or Global Navigation Satellite System technology &nbsp;which allows vehicle users to make payments just by using their device without having to stop. If you rent a vehicle, you can coordinate with the vehicle owner or rental so that it can be ensured that the vehicle you rent is shared by the rental vehicle owner and you are not required to register the vehicle yourself to avoid violations or fines caused by the negligence of other drivers using the same vehicle. In this transitional period, tapping card toll payments such as E-money, Flazz, Brizzi, etc., can be used. Information about the official Cantas website is not currently available to access. Once it is ready, it will be announced through the official channels of PT. Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) and the official channels of the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR). We appreciate your patience for the latest updates from us.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

May I know how it works and what should I do if I had to rent a car because I&#39;m staying in Bali? And where can I find your full information regarding the system? What if I stay using my E-Money to pay toll roads are there any problems?<br><br>Awaiting your feedback, thanks<br></div>
