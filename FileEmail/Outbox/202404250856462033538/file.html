<hr><p>Dear Ms Dhea,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Very well Mrs&nbsp;Dhea Information about the official Cantas website is not currently available to access. Once it is ready, it will be announced through the official channels of PT. Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) and the official channels of the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR). We appreciate your patience for the latest updates from us.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
