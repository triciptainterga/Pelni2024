<hr><p>Dear Mr Pandu Utomo,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Regarding your question, we can inform you that Cantas is an application that allows its users to pay the toll road without having to stop. This is possible due to a system called Multi Lane Free Flow (MLFF) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology integrated with Cantas to keep track of the toll road users. Currently the CANTAS application is still in the trial phase on the Bali toll road, and in the future it will gradually be implemented on all toll roads in Indonesia.</p>

<p>The official release related information of Cantas application will soon be announced through the official channel of PT. Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) and the official channel of PUPR ministry. We thank you for your patience.</p>

<p>We hope the information above can answer your question.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at xxxx.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
