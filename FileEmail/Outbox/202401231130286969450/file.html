<hr><p>Dear Mr. Andre ,&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Very well, Sir. &nbsp;MLFF stands for &quot;Multi Lane Free Flow&quot; which is a non-stop toll payment process, where the toll road users do not need to stop their vehicles at the toll gate to make payments. these are several benefit of having new toll system are:<br />
<br />
1. With the old system you need to stop at the toll gate to pay, with MLFF or Cantas app, you no longer need to stop to pay the toll.<br />
2. The old toll system creates queue at the toll gates, with MLFF or Cantas app, there will be no more queueing at the toll gate.&nbsp;<br />
3. By no longer having queues, there will be no more traffic jams near toll gates which will ultimately reduce fuel waste and air pollution.<br />
4. Compared to the old toll system, you can now track your travel history in detail from the Cantas app&quot;</p>
