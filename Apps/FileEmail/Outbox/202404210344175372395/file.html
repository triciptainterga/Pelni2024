<hr><p>Dear Mr. Cahyadi,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>If you do not have a Cantas account but insist on using toll road, then this conditions will happen :&nbsp;<br />
1. If a user or multiple users register the vehicle to their accounts, the system will send notifications to those accounts that a violation occurred and a fine will be imposed. If one of the accounts pays, then the process will be completed.&nbsp;<br />
2. If none of the accounts that have been sent the notification pay by the specified deadline, or no account is registered at all (the vehicle is not in the system and connected to a user account), then the system will send it to the Police to contact the responsible vehicle owner.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
