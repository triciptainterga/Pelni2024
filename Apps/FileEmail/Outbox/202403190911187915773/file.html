Very well Mr. Cesar, we can inform you for the launch of the Cantas application, it will be announced through the official media of PT. Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) (<em>for now still in development</em>) and the official PUPR media, such as website at <strong>pu.go.id</strong>&nbsp;and Instagram at <strong>@kemenpupr</strong>. Please wait for the latest info from us.<br />
For information, an internal trial of Cantas that using MLFF system has been tested in Bali at the Ngurah Rai Toll Gate (GT), Bali Mandara Toll Road on December 15, 2023, and in the future it will gradually be implemented on all toll roads in Indonesia.<br />
