<hr><p>Dear Mr/ Vino Ramadhani,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Answering Mr. Vino Ramadhani&#39;s question, regarding your problem with the internet connection dying while on the toll road, make sure you have started the trip before entering the toll gate so that there is an initial verification process when using the application.</p>

<p>After passing the toll exit but the internet is still down, we recommend that you turn on the application again when the internet is available for the final verification process of your trip declaration.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
