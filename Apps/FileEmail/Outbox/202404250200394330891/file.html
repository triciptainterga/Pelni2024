<hr><p>Dear Ms. Marisya Kusuma,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Users will get similar features on the Cantas apps and website. On the other hand, the implementation of the Cantas apps makes it easier to use Cantas because users do not need to re-log in when using Cantas apps within a certain time. Then <strong>when starting and ending the trip can only be done through the apps</strong>. On website and apps also have the difference appearance. However, in Cantas apps can use in Android 10 version or higher, then for IOS 13 version or higher. In the other hand, Cantas web can be accessed on all device that supported by device using internet data. Meanwhile, for the future in website you will find feature to buy one trip ticket, but in application you cannot find it.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
