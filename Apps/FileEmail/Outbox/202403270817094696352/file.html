<hr><p>Dear Ms syawalika imanda,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Regarding&nbsp;Ms syawalika imanda&nbsp;&nbsp;we are sorry to inform you that changing the username in the Cantas application is currently not possible. You can create a new Cantas account with another username that you want with another phone number that is connected to Whatsapp.&nbsp;If you want to create an account with a new username but still use the previous phone number, you can delete the account with a processing time of 15 days for permanent deletion. After deleting the account, information related to travel history, fine history, and other information previously recorded in your account will also be deleted</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
