<hr><p>Dear Mr/Ms Amin Prawoto,&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>The new payment system in Bali Toll road will be called MLFF. MLFF stands for &quot;Multi Lane Free Flow&quot; which is a non-stop toll payment process, where the toll road users do not need to stop their vehicles at the toll gate to make payments. You need to download and install CANTAS in your smartphone for using MLFF based toll road system. CANTAS is a smart application designed with (MLFF) or Multi Lane Free Flow system that utilize &nbsp;(GNSS) or Global Navigation Satellite System technology &nbsp;which allows vehicle users to make payments just by using their device without having to stop.</p>

<p>To use the CANTAS application things that need to be considered:<br />
1. Make sure you have added your vehicle data to your &quot;&quot;Vehicle&quot;&quot; menu<br />
2. Make sure you have activated one of the payment methods available on the CANTAS application<br />
3. On the home page of the application select the &quot;&quot;Trip&quot;&quot; menu<br />
4. Select the vehicle you will use. Make sure the vehicle you will use is the same as the one you selected in the application<br />
5. Click &quot;&quot;Start Trip&quot;&quot; button to start your trip with the CANTAS application.<br />
6. Make sure you have clicked the &quot;&quot;Start Trip&quot;&quot; before entering the toll gate.<br />
7. Click &quot;&quot;Stop Trip&quot;&quot; button after you exit the toll gate. If you forget to click the &quot;&quot;Stop Trip&quot;&quot; , the system will automatically end the trip after 2 hours while you&#39;re outside of the toll road.</p>

<p>For now, MLFF still on trial and transition period for invited users. E-money and Flo can still be used when use your rental car on the toll road by choosing regular card tapping toll road gate just before get into the toll road. Regarding the upcoming E-toll and Flo will be replaced with the CANTAS Application as a payment method in using toll roads throughout Indonesia, this is still awaiting confirmation from related parties which will be announced through the official media of PT Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) and official PUPR media. You can check their official media regularly for updated information about CANTAS later.</p>

May I know how it works and what should I do if I had to rent a car because I&#39;m an expatriate in Bali? And where can I find your full information regarding the system? What if I stay using my E-Money to pay toll roads are there any problems? </span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,&quot;Droid Sans&quot;,Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;text-align:-webkit-center"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:&quot;Segoe UI&quot;,Helvetica,&quot;Droid Sans&quot;,Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;text-align:-webkit-center">Awaiting your feedback, thanks</span><br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
