<hr><p>Dear Mr Wahyudin Subakti,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Very well, Mr Wahyudin Subakti. Regarding the penalty, no objection can be raised because it has become a provision of the application which for violations by toll road users will be given a fine. If the violator does not pay the fine through the link sent, the fine will be charged again at the time of vehicle registration renewal.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
