<hr><p>Dear Mr. Wahyudin Subakti,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.<br />
<br />
Very well, Mr. Wahyudin. Cantas is an application designed with (MLFF) or Multi Lane Free Flow system that utilize &nbsp;(GNSS) or Global Navigation Satellite System technology &nbsp;which allows vehicle users to make payments just by using their device without having to stop. MLFF (Multi Lane Free Flow) system works is by detecting the E-OBU or your mobile phone that has the CANTAS application installed, based on GNSS to see the location of your vehicle, and is also supported by the detection camera located on the Gantry which will detect the vehicle number plate and also the vehicle group, whether it matches the one registered by the customer. With the use of the MLFF system, it will facilitate the payment process and will reduce congestion at the entrance and exit of the Toll which was previously required to tap the electronic money card.<br />
<br />
Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from Mr. Wahyudin within 2x24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
