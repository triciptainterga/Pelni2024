Very well, Mr. Yuspa. You can delete your Cantas account with these steps:<br />
1. From main menu, select &quot;<strong>Account</strong>&quot;<br />
2. Select &quot;<strong>Delete account</strong>&quot;<br />
3. Select &quot;<strong>Delete my account</strong>&quot;<br />
4. Enter the OTP code sent to your Whatsapp<br />
<br />
Please note that the process of deleting account will take 15 days. You can cancel this process anytime within those 15 days by logging in again. After deleting the account, information related to travel history, fine history, and other information previously recorded in your account will also be deleted.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from Mr. Yuspa within 2x24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
