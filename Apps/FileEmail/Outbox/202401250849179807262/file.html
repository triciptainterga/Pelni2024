<hr><p>Dear Mr. Reinhard,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We can inform you that the system you are referring to is the MLFF system. MLFF stands for &quot;Multi Lane Free Flow&quot; which is a non-stop toll payment process, where toll road users do not need to stop their vehicles at the toll gate to make payments.</p>

<p>MLFF system can be used through an application system called CANTAS. Cantas is a mobile application to implement a cashless toll payment transaction system carried out at normal speed using contactless technology or known as Multi Lane Free Flow (MLFF).</p>

<p>Here are the steps to use the CANTAS application:&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Toll road users first download the Cantas Application on the Play Store and App Store<br />
- Register by entering personal data and vehicle data<br />
- Select and connect with sources of payment (source of funds) such as electronic money, direct debit banking, etc.<br />
- Ensure sufficient funds<br />
- Ensure the application is active<br />
- The system in the application will be detected when crossing the toll road, then the user&#39;s electronic balance is automatically deducted (transaction process).</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, you must register your vehicle whether it is a private car or a rental car, therefore the vehicle you are using is registered and not subject to fines when using the toll road.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As for&nbsp;The official release date of the Cantas application will be announced through the official channels of PT. Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) and the official channels of the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (PUPR). Kindly await the latest information from us</p>

<p>Information about the official Cantas website is not currently available. Once it is ready, it will be announced through the official channels of PT. Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) and the official channels of the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (PUPR). We appreciate your patience for the latest updates from us.</p>

<p>We can inform you that for now in the transition period E-toll and Flow can still be used when you use the toll road. Regarding the future for E-toll and Flow will be replaced by the CANTAS Application as a payment method in using toll roads throughout Indonesia, this is still awaiting confirmation from related parties which will be announced through the official media of PT Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) and the official PUPR media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812-9238-0699.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation</p>

 method for toll roads, and I find this email on the flyer. May I know how it works and what should I do if I had to rent a car because I'm an expatriate in Bali? And where can I find your full information regarding the system? What if I&nbsp;stay using my E-Money
 to pay toll roads are there any problems?</span></div>
