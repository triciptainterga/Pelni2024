<hr><p>Dear Mr Pak Antony.tmb00,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Okay Mr. Antony.tmb00, to get the OTP code during the registration process, please note the following:&nbsp;<br />
1. The phone number entered is correct and appropriate and registered with the WhatsApp Application<br />
2. Your internet connection is stable with no interruptions&nbsp;<br />
3. The phone number you registered (which is registered with the Whatsapp application) belongs to yourself not someone else<br />
4. Press the &quot;send me a new code&quot; button on the application to send the OTP code again if the OTP code is not received within 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
