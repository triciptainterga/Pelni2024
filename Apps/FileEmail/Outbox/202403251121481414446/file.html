<hr><p>Dear Mrs. Kusuma Marisya,</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Good regarding the question that Mrs. Kusuma Marisya conveyed. We can inform you that the application that Mrs. Marisya has from Hungary is different from the Cantas application in Indonesia, so if Mrs. Marisya wants to use the application, it cannot be done even though it is the same system as the one in Indonesia. To be able to use the Cantas Application in Indonesia, Mrs. Marisya can follow these steps:<br />
1. Click the &quot;Register&quot; button<br />
2. Click the &quot;Agree&quot; button for Terms &amp; Conditions<br />
3. Fill in and complete your personal information (Name, Date of Birth, Address, Username, Password)<br />
4. Enter your phone number connected to your Whatsapp&nbsp;<br />
5. You will receive an OTP (One Time Password) code sent to your Whatsapp number.<br />
6. Enter the OTP code into your Cantas app<br />
7. Your Cantas account is ready to use</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
