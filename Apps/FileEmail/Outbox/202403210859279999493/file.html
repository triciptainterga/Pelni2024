<hr><p>Dear Mr Antony Tambunan,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We can inform you that changing the username on the Cantas application cannot be done right now. You can create a new account using another phone number that is connected to Whatsapp.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can choose to delete your account with the process time of 15 days. After deleting the account, you can choose to create a new account under a new username with the same phone number.</p>

<p>We hope this information can help you.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
