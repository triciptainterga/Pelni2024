<hr><p>Dear Mr Antony,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Alright, Mr Antony. We apologize for the inconvenience that we are currently unable to process the request but there will be a plan in the future so that users can withdraw their money and we will help to escalate this to the relevant team. Then, please help us provide the following data for verification:</p>

<p>1. Username<br />
2. Phone number registered in the Cantas application<br />
3. License plate that is most frequently used for travel.<br />
4. The account number that will be used for disbursement.</p>

<p>If there is any feedback from the relevant team, we will inform you again</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
