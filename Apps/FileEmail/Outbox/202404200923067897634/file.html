<hr><p>Dear Mr Mamonyantai,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Well before we inform you about this to upload STNK photos in the cantas application is optional but suggest to upload if available, you can upload it with a lost card and we can also suggest that for the lost STNK you immediately take care of it again so that your vehicle documents are complete.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
