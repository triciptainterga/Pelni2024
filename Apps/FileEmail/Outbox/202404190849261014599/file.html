<hr><p>Dear Mr/Ms Operation Telmark,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We can inform you that for now the system you are referring to is the MLFF (Multi Lane Free Flow) system, which is a toll payment system without having to stop the vehicle. MLFF technology is presented in Indonesia and is the first technology to implement a contactless cashless toll payment system or pay tolls without stopping based on an application called the CANTAS application for all classes of vehicle types. to use the Cantas application things that need to be considered:</p>

<p>1. Make sure you have added your vehicle data to your &quot;<strong>Vehicle</strong>&quot; menu</p>

<p>2. Make sure you have activated one of the payment methods available on the Cantas application</p>

<p>3. On the home page of the application select the &quot;<strong>Trip</strong>&quot; menu</p>

<p>4. Select the vehicle you will use. Make sure the vehicle you will use is the same as the one you selected in the application</p>

<p>5. Click &quot;<strong>Start Trip</strong>&quot; button to start your trip with the Cantas application.</p>

<p>6. Make sure you have clicked the &quot;<strong>Start Trip</strong>&quot; before entering the toll gate.</p>

<p>7. Click &quot;<strong>Stop Trip</strong>&quot; button after you exit the toll gate. If you forget to click the &quot;<strong>Stop Trip</strong>&quot; , the system will automatically end the trip after 12 hours while you&#39;re outside of the toll road.</p>

<p>But, if you rent a vehicle, you can coordinate with the vehicle owner or rental so that it can be ensured that the vehicle you rent is shared by the rental vehicle owner and you are not required to register the vehicle yourself to avoid violations or fines caused by the negligence of other drivers using the same vehicle.&nbsp;<br />
All informationwill be on the website. But, the official Cantas website is not currently available to access. Once it is ready, it will be announced through the official channels of PT. Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) and the official channels of the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR). We appreciate your patience for the latest updates from us. Also, we can inform you that for now in the transition period E-toll and Flo can still be used when you use the toll road. Regarding the upcoming E-toll and Flo will be replaced with the CANTAS Application as a payment method in using toll roads throughout Indonesia.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

I read a flyer that there will be a new payment method for toll roads, and I found this email on the flyer. May I know how it works and what should I do if I had to rent a car because I'm an expatriate in Bali? And where can I find your full information regarding
 the system? What if I&nbsp;stay using my E-Money to pay toll roads are there any problems?</div>
