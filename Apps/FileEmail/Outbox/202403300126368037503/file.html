<hr><p>Dear Mr. Dody Setiawan,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.<br />
<br />
Very well, Mr. Dody. We are really sorry for your inconvenience, for the notification of fine that you got in your Whatsapp, for the first time you can ensure for several steps below:</p>

<p>1. Check the trip history in Cantas<br />
2. Re-check again in the column of share vehicle, there is still active account Cantas that registered or not<br />
<br />
If still there are unvalid data, you can contact us again with&nbsp;by providing the required evidence.<br />
<br />
Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from Mr. Dody within 2x24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Mr. Dody still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
