<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We can inform you the following are some of the things that can cause fines :</p>

<p>1. insufficient balance<br />
2. not starting the trip<br />
3. when sharing a vehicle that is invited to commit the above offence<br />
4. not making payments such as insufficient balance within 2 hours then the fine will continue to increase</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
