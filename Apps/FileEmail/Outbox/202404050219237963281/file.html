<hr><p>Dear Mr Jose Ochoa,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We may informed that&nbsp;You do not need to worry because there will be no fines or other additional costs because as long as you are still using the toll road and do not press the &quot;<strong>stop trip</strong>&quot; button, you are still counted in the specified time even though the day is different.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
