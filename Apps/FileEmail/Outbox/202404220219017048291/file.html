<hr><p>Dear Mr Antony,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Well Mr. Antony, at this time we can inform you that during the current transition period the MLFF system will be applied in several sections, namely:<br />
1. Nusa Dua - Ngurah Rai - Benoa Toll Road (Bali);<br />
2. Prof. Dr. Ir. Sedyatmo Toll Road, Inner City Toll Road, Jagorawi Toll Road, JORR Toll Road.&nbsp;<br />
Furthermore, the MLFF system will be implemented gradually on all toll road sections in Indonesia.<br />
For information, an internal trial of the MLFF system has been tested in Bali at the Ngurah Rai Toll Gate (GT), Bali Mandara Toll Road on December 15 2023, and in the future it will gradually be implemented on all toll roads in Indonesia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
