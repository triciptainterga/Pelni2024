<hr><p>Dear Ms Nimah Rifda,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We are sorry to inform you that the submission of objections to fines currently cannot be processed, this has become a provision of PT Roatex where for every violation committed by toll road users either intentionally or unintentionally, a fine will be imposed. We can also inform you, if the user does not immediately make payment of fines for violations committed within the time specified for each level of violation, the level of fines will increase to the next level (level 1 to level 3).</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
