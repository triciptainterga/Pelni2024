<hr><p>Dear Ms Marisya Kusuma,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear that. regarding the two payment problems that you are having, we will confirm first:</p>

<p>1. Did you click &quot;<strong>Stop Trip</strong>&quot; while on the toll road?</p>

<p>2. Did your phone previously run out of battery and after that you chose not to continue your trip when you entered the Cantas application?</p>

<p>In the future, to prevent this problem from repeating itself, we suggest not clicking &quot;<strong>Stop Trip</strong>&quot; while on the toll road or you can choose to &quot;<strong>Continue Trip</strong>&quot; if your handphone has previously run out of battery.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
