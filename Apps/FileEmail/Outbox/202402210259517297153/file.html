<hr><p>Dear Ms Marisya Kusuma,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We can inform you that for now the system you are referring to is the MLFF (Multi Lane Free Flow) system, which is a toll payment system without having to stop the vehicle. MLFF technology is present in Indonesia and is the first technology to implement a contactless cashless toll payment system or pay tolls without stopping based on an application called the CANTAS application for all classes of vehicle types. The MLFF system uses Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) digital technology that allows toll road users&#39; trips to be known through GPS on smart phones.</p>
