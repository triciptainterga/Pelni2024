<hr><p>Dear Ms Marisya,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Madam, we can inform you that MLFF stands for &quot;Multi Lane Free Flow&quot; which is a contactless toll payment system that can be done without having to stop at the toll gate. This system is implemented in Indonesia through the CANTAS application with GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) technology that utilizes GPS on smart phones to track toll road users&#39; trips. &nbsp;For information, an internal trial of the MLFF system has been carried out in Bali at the Ngurah Rai Toll Gate (GT), Bali Mandara Toll Road on December 15, 2023, and in the future it will be gradually implemented in all toll roads in Indonesia.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
