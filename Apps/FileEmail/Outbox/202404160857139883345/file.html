<hr><p>Dear Mr Muhammad Alvin,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Very well, Mr Muhammad Alvin. We inform you that Cantas is more efficient than the old toll system because:<br />
1. Toll road users do not stop while paying, without reducing vehicle speed on the toll road<br />
2. Prevent congestion in payments at toll booths<br />
3. Can be downloaded on smart devices as an Electronic On Board Unit or e-OBU<br />
4. Efficient in terms of time, operational costs and energy.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
