<hr><p>Dear Mr Ramadhanivino,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We may informed that&nbsp;If you forget to press the &quot;Start trip&quot;, you can still use the toll road. Cantas system will notify you of a pending payment for your last trip after you exited the toll road. You will then have 2 hours to complete the pending payment before the system flag your account for penalty.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
