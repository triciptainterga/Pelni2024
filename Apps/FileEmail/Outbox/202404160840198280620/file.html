<hr><p>Dear Mr Jauhar Andre,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To use the Cantas application things that need to be considered:</p>

<p>1. Make sure you have added your vehicle data to your &quot;<strong>Vehicle</strong>&quot; menu</p>

<p>2. Make sure you have activated one of the payment methods available on the Cantas application</p>

<p>3. On the home page of the application select the &quot;<strong>Trip</strong>&quot; menu</p>

<p>4. Select the vehicle you will use. Make sure the vehicle you will use is the same as the one you selected in the application</p>

<p>5. Click &quot;<strong>Start Trip</strong>&quot; button to start your trip with the Cantas application.</p>

<p>6. Make sure you have clicked the &quot;<strong>Start Trip</strong>&quot; before entering the toll gate.</p>

<p>7. Click &quot;<strong>Stop Trip</strong>&quot; button after you exit the toll gate. If you forget to click the &quot;<strong>Stop Trip</strong>&quot; , the system will automatically end the trip after 12 hours while you&#39;re outside of the toll road.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can also inform you that MLFF stands for &quot;Multi Lane Free Flow&quot; which is a contactless toll payment system that can be done without having to stop at the toll gate. This system is implemented in Indonesia through the CANTAS app with GNSS technology which uses GPS on smartphones to track the journey of toll road users.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
