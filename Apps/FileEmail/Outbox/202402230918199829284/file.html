<hr><p>Dear Mr Dody Setiawan,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Dody, for the payment of fines from the link you received, you still need to fill in your vehicle data and then you will be directed to the available payments, namely &quot;Digiroad&quot; or &quot;QRis&quot; then you can make payments for the fines you get.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
