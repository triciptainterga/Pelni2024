<hr><p>Dear Mr&nbsp;Muhammad Alvin,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Regarding Mr Muhammad Alvin question about see history of the vehicle has been deleted. We would like to inform you if you delete your Vehicle in your Cantas application you cannot see the previous vehicle that has been deleted because currently there is unavailable to check history of Vehicle in Cantas application, but if you already use for trip in toll road and use Cantas as a payment method in previous vehicle that you already deleted you can check or see your vehicle in &quot;Trip history&quot; menu,&nbsp;to check your travel history, here are the steps:&nbsp;<br />
1. Enter the &quot;Account&quot; menu<br />
2. Select &quot;Trip History&quot;<br />
3. You can set filters and view all your trip history</p>

<p>In additional information for trip history cannot be deleted in Cantas application&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
