<hr><p>Dear Mr Ramadhani Vino,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Currently, we may suggest you to checking first if you&#39;ve gotten a fine or not before? If there is a fine, you can pay it first sir.because the gate will only open if you do not have any outstanding fines. You can pay off the fines so that the gate can open again.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
