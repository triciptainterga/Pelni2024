<hr><p>Dear Ms. Marisya Kusuma,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.<br />
<br />
Very well, Ms. Marisya. We are sorry for your inconvenience. For now, there is no feature for withdraw the Cantas balance to another e-wallet or bank. There will be future plans so that users can withdraw user money. However, this is currently still under internal discussion with BJB (To be advised).<br />
<br />
Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from Ms. Marisya within 2x24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Ms. Marisya still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
