<hr><p>Dear Ms Hana,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We can inform you that you do not need to worry about this, because previously the camera on the gantry could read the existing license plate. If one of your license plates falls off, so Mrs. Hana can still continue the journey until the toll exit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
