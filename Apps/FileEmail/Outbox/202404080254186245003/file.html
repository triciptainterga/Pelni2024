<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Okay, Ms&nbsp;Marisya Kusuma regarding the your problem we suggest to:</p>

<p>1. you Can add photos of vehicles and vehicle registration that were previously available in the photo gallery on the smartphone.</p>

<p>2. If there is a different cellphone, please download the Cantas application and log in with your Username and Password and then upload photos of vehicles and STNK on the phone.</p>

<p>3. If there is a cellphone belonging to a relative or relative, you can take a photo with his cellphone then the picture can be sent to your smartphone then you can upload it in your Cantas application.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
