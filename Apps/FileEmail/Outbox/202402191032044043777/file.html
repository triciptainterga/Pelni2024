<hr><p>Dear Ms. Jayanti Setiawati,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p><br />
Very well, Ms. Jayanti. According to your question if you are a truck driver who always passes the toll road every day to deliver company products, we recommend that you use an OBU (On Board Unit) device on your truck. Later the OBU can be connected to the company&#39;s existing Cantas account.<br />
<br />
For the added information,&nbsp;OBU is a physical device installed on the dashboard of a car that functions as an MLFF (Multi Lane Free Flow) transaction tool.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Ms. Jayanti still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
