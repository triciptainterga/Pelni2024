<hr><p>Dear Mr&nbsp; Cesar Yasin,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We can inform you that in order to use the Cantas application, you can follow these steps<br />
:<br />
1. Make sure you have added your vehicle data to your &quot;Vehicle&quot; menu<br />
2. Make sure you have activated one of the payment methods available on the Cantas application<br />
3. On the home page of the application select the &quot;Trip&quot; menu<br />
4. Select the vehicle you will use. Make sure the vehicle you will use is the same as the one you selected in the application<br />
5. Click &quot;Start Trip&quot; button to start your trip with the Cantas application.<br />
6. Make sure you have clicked the &quot;Start Trip&quot; before entering the toll gate.<br />
7. Click &quot;Stop Trip&quot; button after you exit the toll gate. If you forget to click the &quot;Stop Trip&quot; , the system will automatically end the trip after 30 minutes while you&#39;re outside of the toll road.</p>

<p>We hope this information can help you.</p>
