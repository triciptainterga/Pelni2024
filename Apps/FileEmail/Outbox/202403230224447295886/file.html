<hr><p>Dear Mr. Rizky Alfiandi,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.<br />
<br />
Very well, Mr. Rizky. We are sorry to hear that Mr. Rizky, in order to get the verification code, please make sure these following below:<br />
1. Make sure the phone number you entered is correct&nbsp;<br />
2. Make sure the phone number is registered in your WhatsApp&nbsp;<br />
3. Make sure that you are connected to the internet and have a stable connection&nbsp;<br />
4. Make sure the phone number that you registered is yours and not someone else<br />
5. If you still haven&#39;t received the OTP, please wait for 10 minutes, then click &quot;<strong>send me a new code</strong>&quot;<br />
<br />
Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from Mr. Rizky within 2x24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
