<hr><p>Dear Mr. Dody,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We can inform you that currently because you forgot to press the start travel button, you will get a notification for fines that must be paid. the fines you have are categorized as level 1 fines. you will be given a payment link that you can use to pay fines. we also remind you that payment of fines is not automatically paid when you top up your balance. you can click the link provided and make a fine payment from there. as additional information you can see the history of fines you have on the account page, in the travel history section.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at xxxx.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
