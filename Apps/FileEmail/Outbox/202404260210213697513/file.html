<hr><p>Dear Ms. Ryanti Rahmawati,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We can inform you that for now in the transition period E-toll and Flo can still be used when you use the toll road. Regarding the upcoming E-toll and Flo will be replaced with the CANTAS Application as a payment method in using toll roads throughout Indonesia, this is still awaiting confirmation from related parties which will be announced through the official media of PT Roatex Indonesia Toll System (RITS) and official PUPR media.&nbsp;<br />
We can also inform you that for now the CANTAS application is still in the trial stage at the Bali toll road, but in the future it will gradually be implemented in all toll roads in Indonesia.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
