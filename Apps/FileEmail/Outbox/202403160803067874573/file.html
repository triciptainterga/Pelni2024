<hr><p>Dear Mr&nbsp;Froster Snorts,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Hello Sir, You can delete your Cantas account with these steps:</p>

<p>1. From main menu, select &quot;<strong>Account</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>2. Select &quot;<strong>Delete account</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>3. Select &quot;<strong>Delete my account</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>4. Enter the OTP code sent to your Whatsapp</p>

<p>Please note that the process of deleting account will take 15 days. You can cancel this process anytime within those 15 days by logging in again. After deleting the account, information related to travel history, fine history, and other information previously recorded in your account will also be deleted.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>
