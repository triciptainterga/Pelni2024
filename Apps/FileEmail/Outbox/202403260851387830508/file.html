<hr><p>Dear Mr Mamo,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Regarding your question, if there is a change in vehicle data but with the same previous license plate, then you can make changes in the Cantas application in the following ways:</p>

<p>1. Enter the Cantas application</p>

<p>2. Select the &quot;<strong>Account</strong>&quot; menu</p>

<p>3. Press the &quot;<strong>Vehicle</strong>&quot; button</p>

<p>4. Select the vehicle whose data will be changed</p>

<p>5. Make changes to vehicle data and photos of the latest vehicle documents</p>

<p>6. Select &quot;<strong>Save Changes</strong>&quot; if the data is correct</p>

<p>However, if there is a change in the vehicle license plate, then you can directly add the vehicle only, because the license plate that has been registered in the application cannot be changed. Here&#39;s how to add a vehicle:</p>

<p>1. Select the &quot;<strong>Account</strong>&quot; menu</p>

<p>2. Select the &quot;<strong>Vehicle</strong>&quot; menu</p>

<p>3. Click the &quot;<strong>Add Vehicle</strong>&quot; button or the Plus sign</p>

<p>4. Select the toll category that matches your vehicle</p>

<p>5. Enter your vehicle information, then click &quot;<strong>Next</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>6. Upload the front and back photos of your vehicle, then click &quot;<strong>Next</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>7. Upload a photo of your vehicle&#39;s front and rear vehicle registration (STNK)</p>

<p>8. Click &quot;<strong>Finish</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
