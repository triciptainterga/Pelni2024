<hr><p>Dear Mr Ramavino,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Mr Ramavino, please make sure that the recipient of the invitation has received the invitation first so that they can &quot;Start the Trip&quot; with the vehicle being shared. Here&#39;s how to accept the vehicle invitation:<br />
1. Go to the Cantas application<br />
2. Select the &quot;Account&quot; menu<br />
3. Select &quot;Vehicle Sharing Invitation&quot;<br />
4. Select the vehicle to share<br />
5. Select &quot;Accept Invitation&quot;.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>
