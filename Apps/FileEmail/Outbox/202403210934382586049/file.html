<hr><p>Dear Mr Wahyudin Subakti,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Regarding of Mr Wahyudin Subakti question about Cantas application for the rent vehicle. We can inform you there is no special rules for the user but if you rent a vehicle we suggest you to coordinate with the vehicle owner or rental so that it can be ensured that the vehicle you rent is shared by the rental vehicle owner and you are not required to register the vehicle yourself to avoid violations or fines caused by the negligence of other drivers using the same vehicle. For the information make sure you have driving license and if you are a foreigner you can use an international driving license for create your Cantas application.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
