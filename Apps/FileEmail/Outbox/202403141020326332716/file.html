<hr><p>Dear Mr/Ms Jingga&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Related to the question can be done in two ways,</p>

<p>1. You can use the sharing vehicle feature where this feature for travel costs will be covered by the sender of the invitation<br />
2. Registering the vehicle is on your sister&#39;s cantas account and the costs will be covered by account owner.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

Thanks :)</div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div>Jingga</div></div>
