<hr><p>Dear Ms. Hanii,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We understand your question regarding how to add a vehicle, add payment methods, and fine schemes on the Cantas application. I can inform you that&nbsp;to add a vehicle in your Cantas account, you can follow these steps:<br />
1. Select the &quot;Account&quot; menu<br />
2. Select the &quot;Vehicle&quot; menu<br />
3. Click the &quot;Add Vehicle&quot; button or the Plus sign<br />
4. Select the toll category that matches your vehicle<br />
5. Enter your vehicle information, then click &quot;Next&quot;<br />
6. Upload photos of your front and rear vehicle, then click &quot;Next&quot;<br />
7. Upload photos of your front and back vehicle registration document<br />
8. Click &quot;Finish&quot;</p>

<p>For the next question about adding payment methods in your Cantas account, you can follow these steps:<br />
1. Select &quot;Account&quot; menu<br />
2. Select &quot;Payment Service&quot;<br />
3. Click the &quot;Add Payment Method&quot; button<br />
4. Select the payment method of your choice<br />
5. You can now use the payment method of your choice</p>

<p>For the last question you asked,&nbsp;the fine scheme for violations of underpayment of toll rates is as follows:</p>

<p>*If you pay the underpayment before 2 hours after receiving the underpayment notification, the amount to be paid is only the shortage without any additional fees or fines. Regarding the fine you&#39;ve received, we would like to provide clarification on our system.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;At Cantas, we have several different levels of fine, determined by the time after a violation:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;Level 1 Fine: This is issued immediately after a violation occurs.<br />
&nbsp;Level 2 Fine: Issued after the fine is not paid within 2 to 10 days after the violation.<br />
&nbsp;Level 3: 1.5 toll rates for a duration of more than 10x24 hours until an indefinite time. At this level, toll gates will not open and STNK renewal will be blocked.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
