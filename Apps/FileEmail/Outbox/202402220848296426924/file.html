<hr><p>Dear Mr Muhammad Alvin Juliardy Santofia,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>For now you can use e-toll card for using Jakarta - Solo Tollroad. Later after CANTAS implemented when you buy e-ticket to this route, you should follow the planned route when buy e-ticket. In this case, If you exit the toll road before destination that already planned, your e-ticket status will be used. You cannot use that e-ticket again. You have to buy e-ticket again for using tollroad. You don&#39;t have to use CANTAS when buy e-ticket.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

But in the middle of the road I got out at the Kanci toll gate because I wanted to stay at my brother&#39;s house, the next day I continued my journey via the Pemalang toll gate. The question is that the previous e-Ticket can still be used or I have to buy again? and Will I be charged a fine on my Cantas application? or I can use the Cantas application and press Start Trip ???<br><br></div>
