<hr><p>Dear Mr Cesar,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Well Mr. Cesar, we can inform you that the first phase trial or transition period of MLFF is planned in Bali because the number of toll roads in Bali is not as many as the toll roads in Java and Jakarta. And the mobility on the Bali Toll Road is not as dense as in Jakarta, so we conducted a limited trial for toll users. &nbsp;During the transition period, the MLFF system will be implemented in several sections and divided into two stages, namely:&nbsp;<br />
The first stage along the Nusa Dua - Ngurah Rai - Benoa Toll Road (Bali).<br />
Second phase along Prof. Dr. Ir. Sedyatmo Toll Road, Inner City Toll Road, Jagorawi Toll Road, JORR Toll Road.&nbsp;<br />
So we hope that in the future this MLFF system will be implemented in stages on all toll roads in Indonesia.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
