<hr><p>Dear Ms Ryanti Rahmawati,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Very well Ms Ryanti Rahmawati, we can inform you that Open Toll is a category where the toll road price you have to pay is the same regardless of your exit. And Closed Toll, is a category where the toll road price you have to pay depends on where you exit.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
