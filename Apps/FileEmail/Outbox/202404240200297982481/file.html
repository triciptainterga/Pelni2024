<hr><p>Dear Ms. Marisya Kusuma,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Some of the benefits of Cantas, among others:</p>

<p>1. Toll road users do not stop in payment, without lowering the speed of the vehicle in tolling</p>

<p>2. Prevents congestion in payment at the toll booth</p>

<p>3. Can be downloaded on smart devices as an Electronic On Board Unit or e-OBU</p>

<p>4. Can be used in real time regardless of time and weather.</p>

<p>5. The use of GNSS in relative positioning is not affected by the topographical conditions of the region.</p>

<p>7. The position determined refers to global time which is relatively precise and easy to realize.</p>

<p>8. Provides positioning accuracy with a wide enough spectrum.</p>

<p>9. Free of charge.</p>

<p>10. Efficient in time, operational costs and manpower.</p>

<p>11. Data manipulation on GNSS is more difficult to do</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
