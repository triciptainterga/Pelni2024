<hr><p>Dear Mr. Cesar Yasin,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can inform you that to delete sharing a vehicle, the following steps must be taken:</p>

<p>1. Click &quot;Account&quot;</p>

<p>2. Then, select &quot;Vehicle&quot;</p>

<p>3. After that, customize the car that is being shared</p>

<p>4. Then, click the &quot;Delete&quot; icon</p>

<p>Make sure that this is done by the account owner who is doing the &quot;Sharie Vehicle&quot;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>
