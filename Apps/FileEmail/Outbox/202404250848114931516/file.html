<hr><p>Dear Mr Cesar Yasin,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Very well Cesar Yasin, Cantas is an application on cellphones used in implementing the toll payment system. By using the MLFF (Multi Lane Free Flow) system, the toll payment process is non-stop, meaning toll road users do not have to stop their vehicles at the toll gate to make payments. And one of the conditions for using the Cantas application is that the device specifications required for your smartphone must have at least the Android 10 operating system for Android users and iOS 13 for iPhone users.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
