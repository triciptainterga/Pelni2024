<hr><p>Dear Mr. Anthony,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>We can inform you that you cannot see the travel history of your car that is registered separately in your friend&#39;s account. You can see the travel history of the car you have if your friend uses the vehicle through vehicle sharing in the cantas application.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at xxxx.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
