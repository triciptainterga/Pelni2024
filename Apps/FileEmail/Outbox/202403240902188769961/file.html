<hr><p>Dear Ms Ryanti,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Very well, Ms Ryanti. We will inform you of several advantages of the GNSS-based MLFF system, including:<br />
1. Toll road users do not stop while paying, without reducing vehicle speed on the toll road<br />
2. Congestion in payments at toll booths<br />
3. Can be downloaded on smart devices as an Electronic On Board Unit or e-OBU<br />
4. Can be used in real time without depending on time and weather.<br />
5. The use of GNSS in determining relative position does not affect the topographic conditions of the area.<br />
7. The specified position refers to global time which is relatively precise and easy to realize.<br />
8. Provides positional accuracy with a fairly wide spectrum.<br />
9. There is no charge.<br />
10. Efficient in terms of time, operational costs and energy.<br />
11. Data manipulation in GNSS is more difficult</p>

<p>Weaknesses of MLFF, as follows:<br />
1. GNSS-based MLFF relies heavily on GSM (3G/4G/5G) cellular networks along toll roads<br />
2. There must be an additional OBU on the vehicle or e-OBU on the smartphone.<br />
3. Not all toll road users have mastered IT technology on GNSS-based smartphones.<br />
4. There is always a balance in the e-wallet.<br />
5. Always have internet data on your smart device when on the toll road.</p>

<p>However, as time and technology develop, some of these weaknesses will be overcome with further outreach so that other people can easily use the MLFF system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
