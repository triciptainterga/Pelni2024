<hr><p>Dear Ms Jayanti.linksindo,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Okay, Ms.Jayanti.linksindo, regarding the obstacles we suggest:<br />
1. Can add photos of vehicles and vehicle registration that were previously available in the photo gallery on the cellphone.<br />
2. If there is a different cellphone, please download the Cantas application and log in with your Username and Password and then upload photos of vehicles and STNK on the cellphone.<br />
3. If there is a cellphone belonging to a relative or relative, you can take a photo with his cellphone then the picture can be sent to your cellphone then you can upload it in your Cantas application.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
