<hr><p>Dear Ms Marisya,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Well Ms.Marisya, the difference between the old toll system and MLFF are:</p>

<p>1. With the old system you need to stop at the toll gate to pay, with MLFF or Cantas app, you no longer need to stop to pay the toll.</p>

<p>2. The old toll system creates queue at the toll gates, with MLFF or Cantas app, there will be no more queueing at the toll gate.</p>

<p>3. By no longer having queues, there will be no more traffic jams near toll gates which will ultimately reduce fuel waste and air pollution.</p>

<p>4. Compared to the old toll system, you can now track your travel history in detail from the Cantas app</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at xxxx.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
