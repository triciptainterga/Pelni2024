<hr><p>Dear Mr Jauhar Andre Wicaksono,</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Regarding the question that Jauhar raised. We can inform you&nbsp;<br />
Here are the steps to use the Cantas app:<br />
1. Download the Cantas App on the Play Store or App Store<br />
2. You register by entering your personal data and vehicle data<br />
3. Select and connect with the payment method in the application<br />
4. Ensure sufficient balance with a minimum balance of Rp 20,000 in the Cantas application in order to travel<br />
5. Ensure that the vehicle selected in the application matches the one in use<br />
6. Make sure you have selected &quot;Start Trip&quot; before entering the toll road<br />
7. The system will detect when your vehicle crosses the toll road then the balance in the application will be deducted automatically according to the toll tariff that is passed.</p>

<p>And then for the Cantas application must be connected to the internet network when used and will not be able to be used if the internet is off.</p>
