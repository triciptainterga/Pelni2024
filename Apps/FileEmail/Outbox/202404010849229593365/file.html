<hr><p>Dear Mr Jauhar,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Cantas email service.</p>

<p>Well, here we inform you about the question above, the difference between Cantas web and Cantas application is that users will get almost the same features on the Cantas application and website. On the other hand, the implementation of the Cantas application makes it easier for users to use Cantas, because users do not need to log in again when using the Cantas application within a certain time, then when &quot;start trip&quot; and &quot;end trip&quot; can be done through the application. On the website and application also have differences in appearance. However, the Cantas application can be used on Android version 10 and above, then for iOS version 13 and above. Meanwhile, Cantas web can be accessed on all devices connected to the internet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the future on the website you will find a feature to buy a &quot;one-way ticket&quot;, but in the application it cannot be found.</p>

<p>1. There is no &quot;Start Trip&quot; feature in the Cantas Web view and only in the Cantas application<br />
2. There is no language change option on the Cantas app, but there is a language change option on the Cantas web view.</p>

<p>Related to the above, if we do not receive any response or information from you within 2X24 hours, then we consider you have already understood this matter, hence we will close this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still have other questions or queries, you may contact our Cantas Contact Center at 021-50869996 or our Cantas WhatsApp service at 0812 8630 5888.</p>

<p>This is the information that we can convey. Thank you for your kind attention and cooperation.</p>
